# Pythagorean Triples: 3,4,5 as 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 or 6,8,10 similar logic.
# Task: Given a number n, n > 0, find all the triples from 1 til n.
# eg: n = 5, output [[3,4,5]]
# n = 10, output [[3,4,5], [6,8,10]]

# Please attempt this by next week! Solve in at least 2 of these ways:
# traditional for loop
# Using Filters/maps
# List comprehensions

Triplets = []
numbers = [range(1,10)]

for n in numbers
